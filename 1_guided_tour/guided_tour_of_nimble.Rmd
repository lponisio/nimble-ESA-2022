# Workshop organization

- Today's modules 
- 1. Overview of `nimble`, intro to Hidden Markov models, fitting a dynamic occypancy model. 
- 2. `nimbleEcology` distributions for capture-recapture, occupancy, dynamic occupancy

- Bonus modules 
- 1. CJS capture-recapture model with dipper data
- 2. Extending models and methods using `nimbleFunction`s for efficiency and generality. 
- 3. Speeding up spatial capture-recapture (`nimbleSCR`).

# What Is NIMBLE?
- **N**umerical **I**nference for statistical **M**odels using **B**ayesian and **L**ikelihood **E**stimation.
- A framework for hierarchical statistical models and methods.
- A nearly drop-in alternative to WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and JAGS.
- An extension of the BUGS language for:

    - writing new functions and distributions.
    - named alternative parameterizations (e.g. sd vs precision for `dnorm`).
    - Additional R-like coding, including vectorized declarations.
    
- A configurable system for MCMC.

- A library of other methods.
  - Sequential Monte Carlo (particle filtering)
  - Particle MCMC
  - Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (maximum likelihood)
  - Reversible jump MCMC for variable selection
  - Special components for Conditional Auto-Regressive (CAR) models (spatial) and Bayesian non-parametric distributions (BNP).

- A model-generic programming system to write new analysis methods using two-stage `nimbleFunction`s.

# Assumptions for this workshop

- You are familiar with the BUGS/JAGS model language.
- You are familiar with occupancy statistical models 
- The emphasis of this workshop is on the `nimble` and`nimbleEcology` 

Hidden Markov models (Intro)
---

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a general statistical framework for:

- systems with discrete latent states (usually) and discrete time steps

    * probabilities of transitioning between states at each time step

- discrete observation categories and imperfect observation 
    
    *  probabilities of being observed in one category given the (true) latent state.

- If transition and/or observation probabilities are time-dependent, we call it a "Dynamic HMM" (DHMM).

---

# Hidden Markov models in site occupancy models

- latent states are the presence or absence of a species at discrete spatial locations
- observed states are imperfect because the probability of detection != 1
- repeat samples at a spatial location enable the estimate of the latent states

---

# HMM example: Single species, multi season ("dynamic") occupancy model

- Uses data simulations from Kery and Schaub [Bayesian Population Analysis using WinBUGS]( https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123870209/bayesian-population-analysis-using-winbugs)
- We will parameterize 1) the rates at which species persist in patches in which they already occur and 2) the rates at which species colonize patches in which they donâ€™t occur. Occupancy then emerges as the net outcome of these two processes.

# Single species multi season occupancy 

$\mbox{logit}(\psi_{i,j+1}) = \phi_{j} * z_{i,k} + \gamma_{j} * (1-z_{i,j})$.

-  $\psi_{i,j}$ is the occupancy probability at the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ site in the
$j^{\mathrm{th}}$ year.
- $\phi_{j}$ denotes the probability the species persists at a site from years $j$ to $j+1$ (given that $z_{i,j}=1$) 
- $\gamma_{j}$ denotes the probability that site $i$ is colonized in year $j+1$ (given that $z_{i,j}=0$).


---

## Simulate the data 
- There will be 250 sites sampled 3 times per year for 10 years. (Won't this be lovely?)
- data, y: 1 = not-detected, 2 = detected.
- latent states, z: 1 = present, 0 = absent 
- Simulate a time-constant model with 3 different covariates affecting the 3 parameters (phi, gamma, p)  (uses the function from the AHMbook package)

---

```{r sim_dOcc_data} 
set.seed(444)

# simulate a time-constant model with 3 different covariates affecting the 3 parameters (phi, gamma, p)

occ.data <- AHMbook::simDynocc(
  nsites = 250,
  nyears = 10,
  nsurveys = 3,
  mean.psi1 = 0.6, # average occupancy probability in first year
  beta.Xpsi1 = 0, # coefficient of environ covariate in p(initial occupancy).
  range.phi = c(0.7, 0.7), # bounds of uniform distribution from which annual p(persistence) is randomly drawn.
  beta.Xphi = 1, # coefficients of environ covariate in p(persistence).
  range.gamma = c(0.3, 0.3), # bounds of uniform distribution from which annual p(colonization) is randomly drawn.
  beta.Xgamma = 1, # coefficient of environmental covariate in p(colonization).
  range.p = c(0.5, 0.5), # bounds of uniform distribution from which annual p(detection) is randomly drawn.
  beta.Xp = 1, # coefficient of environmental covariate in p(detection).
  show.plot = TRUE)

```{r dOcc_code}
dOcc_code <- nimbleCode({
  for (site in 1:nsite) {
    for (year in 1:nyear) {
      ## persistence
      logit(phi[site, year]) <- beta[1] + beta[2] * Xphi[site, year]
      ## colonization
      logit(gamma[site, year]) <- beta[3] + beta[4] * Xgamma[site, year]
      ## detection
      for (survey in 1:nsurvey) {
        logit(p[site, year, survey]) <- beta[5] + beta[6] * Xp[site, survey, year]
      }
    }

  }

  ## Ecological submodel: Define state conditional on parameters
  for (site in 1:nsite){
    z[site,1] ~ dbern(psi1)
    for (year in 2:nyear){
      muZ[site, year] <- z[site, year-1]*phi[site, year-1] +
        (1-z[site, year-1])*gamma[site, year-1]
      z[site, year] ~ dbern(muZ[site, year])
    }
    }

  for (site in 1:nsite){
    for (survey in 1:nsurvey){
      for (year in 1:nyear){
        muy[site, year, survey] <- z[site, year]*(p[site, year, survey])
        y[site, year, survey] ~ dbern(muy[site, year, survey])

# Setup data, constants, and inits

```{r setupInputs}

## data zs with 0s set to NAs
zs <- apply(occ.data$y, c(1, 3), max, na.rm=TRUE)
zs[zs == 0] <- NA

## initial conditions, NAs where 1s in z, and 1s are where NA
zinits <- zs
zinits[zinits == 1] <- 2
zinits[is.na(zinits)] <- sample(0:1, sum(is.na(zinits)), 
                                replace=TRUE) ## random 1,0 for unobserved
zinits[zinits == 2] <- NA

head(zinits)
head(zs)
```

---

## Compare z an z inits

- Where a species was detected, a 1 is provided in the data. There is no need to set up a sampler to sample this node. This would be wasted computation.
- The same nodes in the inits get an NA because there is no reason to have a initial condition for a node you will not sample
-Where it wasn't detected, NA is provided in the data so nimble knows to sample that note as a latent state 

---

```{r setupInputs2}
## constants

dOcc_constants <- list(nsite = occ.data$nsites,
                  nsurvey = occ.data$nsurveys,
                  nyear = occ.data$nyears)

## data 
dOcc_data <- list(y = aperm(occ.data$y, c(1, 3, 2)),
                  z = zs,
                  Xphi = occ.data$Xphi,
                  Xgamma = occ.data$Xgamma,
                  Xp = occ.data$Xp)

## initial conditions
dOcc_inits <- list(z = zinits,
                  psi1 = runif(1, 0, 1),
                  beta = runif(6, -2, 2))
```

# What are constants? What are data?

### Constants are values needed to define model relationships

- Index starting/ending values like `N`
- Constant indexing vectors for indexing data groupings (site, treatment, individual, time): `beta[ treatment[i] ]`.
- Constants must be provided when creating a model with `nimbleModel`.

### Data represents a flag on the role a node plays in the model

- E.g., data nodes shouldn't be sampled in MCMC.
- Data *values* can be changed.
- Data can be provided when calling `nimbleModel` or later.

### Providing data and constants together.

- Data and constants can be provided together **as `constants`**.
- It would be slightly easier for BUGS/JAGS users to call this "data", but that would blur the concepts.  
- NIMBLE will usually disambiguate data and constants when they are provided together as `constants`.

### What are covariates and other non-parameters/non-observations?

- Covariates/predictors are neither parameters nor data in the sense of the likelihood.
- Covariates/predictors can be provided via `constants` if you don't need to change them (often the case).
- Covariates/predictors can be provided via `data` or `inits` if you want to change them.
  - NIMBLE will not treat them as 'data nodes'.

# Create a model

```{r nimbleModel, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
dOcc_model <- nimbleModel(code = dOcc_code,
                          constants = dOcc_constants,
                          data = dOcc_data,     # data can be set later.
                          inits = dOcc_inits  # inits can be set later.
                          )                      
```
```{r nimbleModel_eval}
dOcc_model$initializeInfo()                    
```

---

# Create an MCMC

```{r configureMCMC, eval=TRUE}
dOcc_MCMCconf <- configureMCMC(dOcc_model) # defaults to top-level parameters  
dOcc_MCMC <- buildMCMC(dOcc_MCMCconf)
```

# Compile the model and MCMC

## 3. Compile the model and MCMC

```{r compileNimble, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = TRUE}
C_dOcc_model <- compileNimble(dOcc_model) # These two lines can be done in one line.
C_dOcc_MCMC <- compileNimble(dOcc_MCMC, project = dOcc_model)
```

## 4. Run the MCMC

```{r runMCMC, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = TRUE}
samples <- runMCMC(C_dOcc_MCMC, niter = 10000, 
                   samplesAsCodaMCMC = TRUE,
                   nchains=3,
                   nburnin=5000)
# Alternative:
# C_dOcc_MCMC$run(1000)
# samples <- as.matrix(C_dOcc_MCMC$mvSamples)
summary(samples)
plot(samples)
```

# How can I use the model in R?

```{r nimbleModel2, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# Rebuild the model here for safe knitr behavior
#dOcc_model <- nimbleModel(code = dOcc_code,
#                            constants = dOcc_constants,
#                            data = dOcc_data,     # data can be set later.
#                            inits = dOcc_inits  # inits can be set later.
#                            )                        
# C_dOcc_model <- compileNimble(dOcc_model) 
```

```{r model_demo, eval=TRUE}
class(dOcc_model)[1]  # This is a reference class (S5) object
dOcc_model$gamma           # Look at a model variable,
dOcc_model$y[1:2,, ]        # or part of one.
dOcc_model$isData('gamma') # Query what is data
dOcc_model$getNodeNames()[1:10]  # Query what are the nodes (vertices) in the graph,
dOcc_model$getDependencies("z[1, 3]") # and what depends on what..
dOcc_model$calculate()     # Calculate the entire model. Return sum of log probabilities.
dOcc_model$calculate('z[1, 3]') # Calculate one or more nodes in the model.
dOcc_model$calculate(dOcc_model$getDependencies('z[1, 3]')) # Calculate based on model structure.
dOcc_model$simulate("y", includeData = TRUE) # Simulate new data
head(dOcc_model$y)
dOcc_model$calculate("y")   # Calculate new sum of log probabilities
C_dOcc_model$y <- dOcc_model$y # The compiled model can be used in the same way
C_dOcc_model$calculate()
```

# Differences from NIMBLE to JAGS and/or BUGS

* See our [guide on converting from JAGS to NIMBLE](https://r-nimble.org/quick-guide-for-converting-from-jags-or-bugs-to-nimble)
* Wrap your model code in `nimbleCode({})` directly in R.
* Provide information about missing or empty indices:

   * Use `x[1:n, 1:m]` or
   * `x[,]` with `dimensions = list(x = c(n,m))`.
   * Do not use `x` without brackets (unless it is a scalar).
* Decide how much control you need:

    * `nimbleMCMC` will do everything.
    * `nimbleModel`, `configureMCMC`, `buildMCMC`, `compileNimble` and `runMCMC` give you more control.
